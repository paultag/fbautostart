NAME
----
fbautostart - Autostart all XDG applications

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbautostart* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbautostart(1)* is an XDG compliant startup tool. This will
go through the directories set up by the spec, and start all
applications that match its current identifier. You may change
that identifier with the *FBXDG_DE* env var.

This tool has almost no library dependencies and was written to be smart
about that sort of stuff. There is a greater then average chance
that you will find a bug, since it is a from-scratch implementation of the
.desktop spec. Please report bugs. Please.

FILES
-----
*~/.config/autostart*::
	This folder contains the default user XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden by an ENV variable )

*/etc/xdg*::
	This folder contains the default system XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden by an ENV variable )


OPTIONS
-------

Sadly, there are no flags in this particular release.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*XDG_CONFIG_HOME*::
	The XDG root directory for the user's startup
	files, which may override the global startup files.

*XDG_CONFIG_DIRS*::
	The root XDG directory, where global XDG files are
	maintained.

*FBXDG_DE*::
	Desktop environment that we should act upon. This
	defaults to "FLUXBOX", since this is a fluxbox project,
	after all. Please note this is case sensitive.

*FBXDG_EXEC*::
	This dictates if we should execute the application that
	we've been told to or not. This is particularly useful
	for debugging the app.

    Set this value to 0 to execute, and 1 to play dummy. I realize how silly
    this is, and this behavior will likely change (with a deprecation of this
    env-var, so don't worry about this falling out from under your feet.)

*HOME*::
	The location of the user's home directory, such that ~/ will be 
	expanded to /home/user/
