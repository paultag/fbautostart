NAME
----
fbautostart - Autostart all XDG applications

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbautostart* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbautostart(1)* is an XDG complaint startup tool. This will
go through the directories set up by the spec, and start all
applications that match it's current identifier. You may change
that identifier with the *FBXDG_DE* env var.

This tool has almost no library dependencies and was written to be smart
about that sort of stuff. There is a greater then average chance
that you will find a bug, since it is a from-scratch implementation of the
.desktop spec. Pleas report bugs. Please.

FILES
-----
*~/.config/autostart*::
	This folder contains the default user XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden by an ENV variable )

*/etc/xdg*::
	This folder contains the default system XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden by an ENV variable )


OPTIONS
-------

Sadly, there are no flags in this particular release.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*XDG_CONFIG_HOME*::
	The XDG root directory for the user's startup
	files, which may override the global startup files.

*XDG_CONFIG_DIRS*::
	The root XDG directory, where global XDG files are
	maintained.

*FBXDG_DE*::
	Development enviroment that we should act upon. This
	defaults to "FLUXBOX", since this is a fluxbox project,
	after all. Please note this is case sensitive.

*FBXDG_EXEC*::
	This dictates if we should execute the application that
	we've been told to or not. This is particularly useful
	for debugging the app.

*HOME*::
	The location of one's home directory, such that ~/ will be expanded
	to /home/user/
