* Removed the #define for the window manager setting in
include/fbautostart.h. It's now a const char, and dynamic
with the new --window-manager flag.
* Changed fbautostart to error out when you pass in a bum
flag. This caused me great pain the other day. Fixed now.
* Forgot to bump the version number. It's now version 2.71828.
Both of these changes were in src/fbautostart.cpp

* Bugfixes for random crap for XDG env issues.
This is a fix for issues that I missed when fixing
Segaja's issues.
